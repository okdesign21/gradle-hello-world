2. Understand this repository -
a. Which programming language is this?
b. What is gradle?
c. How does gradle work?
d. What is this gradle wrapper everyone keeps mentioning?

4. Change the code:
    a. Add your name to the "Hello World" message.
b. Set Jar version to 1.0.0

5. Create a simple pipeline which would do the following actions:
a. Increase the Patch part of the jar version ( 1.0.0 - > 1.0.1-> …) automatically
b. Compile the code
c. Package it into an artifact.
d. Create an artifact item for the build.
e. Create SBOM and publish it (Use Trivy its free)
f. Sign the Artifact (You can use Cosign for example…)
g. Create a docker image containing the artifact - use Dockerfile:
i. Tag the Docker image as the Jar version automatically.
ii. The Docker image shouldn't run with root.
h. Push the docker image that was created in the previous step to Docker Hub
i. Download and run the docker image.
6. Once it’s running, we will come and pick you up immediately.

Bonus – do as much as possible from the above using Multistage Docker
